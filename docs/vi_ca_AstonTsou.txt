The basic idea is that there are three types of creators:

1. Perfecter--An artist who takes a current style and maximizes its potential, elevating it to the best it can be (e.q. Bach, Mozart, Brahms, Spielberg, James Cameron, Stephen King, Pixar, etc.)

2. Innovator--An artist who breaks the mold, consistently trying new things or pioneering a new style(e.g. Beethoven, Schoenberg, Kubrick, Picasso, Joyce, Dali, etc.)

3. Synthesizer--An artist who draws from disparate sources, makes unexpected connections, and creates something both familiar and new (e.g. Ligeti, Stravinsky, David Lynch, Tarantino, Murakami, etc.)
